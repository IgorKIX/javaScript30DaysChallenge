# javaScript30DaysChallenge

### Description:
The author of this course is Wes Bos. The idea of this "challenge" is to get to know interesting, useful and at the same time often simple tricks that we make using vanilla JS. The course is available for free on [this website](https://javascript30.com/)

### Days:
1. A simple durm kit that allows you to stimulate your creative beast and delve into your own creative music world :wink: (lesson of capturing keystrokes and handling audio files). *
2. A nice clock showing the current time. This feat was made possible by introducing changes to transformation properties and thanks to such methods as now.getHours! <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/2 Clock rotate/index.html">Click here!</a>
3. This time, with the help of event listeners and css variables, we run two sliders and a color picker, which allows us to adjust the look and background of the photo. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/3 Playing with css variables/index.html">Click here!</a>
4. This time there were a few tasks to be completed, requiring knowledge of the basic table methods, like: filter, map, sort and reduce. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/4 Array reduce, sort, filter, map + trick/index.html">Click here!</a>
5. Very efficient use of property transform along with the event listeners to create a spectacular-looking site. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/5 Flex transition/index.html">Click here!</a>
6. A page with a "search engine". Data downloaded using ajax and a search based on the filter method on the array. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/6 Ajax Find match/index.html">Click here!</a>
7. The next exercise with several array methods (some, every, find, findIndex) and two ways to remove one element from the array. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/7 Array Some every find findIndex slice/index.html">Click here!</a>
8. This time, using canvas, I create a white and clean surface waiting for creative use. The psychedelic effect is enhanced by continuously changing the color and size of the brush :dizzy_face: I use methods such as: lineTo, beginPath, moveTo and stroke. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/8 Canvas/index.html">Click here!</a>
9. In this exercise I'm getting familiar with ocuple console tricks using methods such as count, grouCollapsed, time, error, warning and assert. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/9 console tricks/index.html">Click here!</a>
10. In this exercise, I write the simple method to implement the ability to select couple check boxes at once when the shift key is press down. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/10 checkbox & shift/index.html">Click here!</a>
11. In this exercise, I'm Wes shows how to implement basic support for video player. There are implemented features such as progress bar that allows you to directly jump to a particular part of the movie, change the playback tempo and volume. * **
12. In this very simple exercise, implementations of something like konami code are shown. Typing a secret password to the console will display a hidden message. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/12 Key sequence detection/index.html">Click here!</a>
13. This exercise focuses on showing how to implement image slides during the page scrolling by the user. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/13 Scrolling with pictures/index.html">Click here!</a>
14. This exercise shows the difference between reference and copy of array and object, and shows couple ways of copying them. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/14 Copy of array and object/index.html">Click here!</a>

20. This task shows how to use the ability to transcribe speech into a letters. (unfortunately I have to spend more time to make this code work correctly). ***
21. A simple application showing the speed of movement and the geographical direction of the march. Unfortunately, I could not test its operation :disappointed: ***
22. In this exercise i shown a simple link highlighting effect is shown after hovering over it with mouse. The highlight effect "travels" from one link to another, while actively adapting its shape. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/22 Follow along links/index.html">Click here!</a>
23. In this exercise is shown the use of the api (SpeechSynthesisUtterance) built into the modern browser, allowing the reading of the typed text. The list of available voices depends on the operating system used and the browser used. Unfortunately it doesn't work on firefox :disappointed: <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/23 Speech synth/index.html">Click here!</a>
24. In this exercise is shown a useful trick to make nav move with the user when he scrolls down the page. <a href="https://igorkix.github.io/javaScript30DaysChallenge/24 Moving nav/index.html">Click here!</a>


*I didn't add the click me button here because so far I'm not sure how to attach audio and video files so that they can be played <br />

**I saw this fat bunny video so many times in different exercises, that I'm getting epilepsis attack after 0.1 second of watching it... <br />

***After downloading the files, open the command line in the folder with the files and enter npm install. When all necessary things are downloaded, enter the npm start which will result with launching the server and opening web browser on local host page.
