# javaScript30DaysChallenge

### Description:
The author of this course is Wes Bos. The idea of this "challenge" is to get to know interesting, useful and at the same time often simple tricks that we make using vanilla JS. The course is available for free on [this website](https://javascript30.com/)

### Days:
1. A simple durm kit that allows you to stimulate your creative beast and delve into your own creative music world :wink: (lesson of capturing keystrokes and handling audio files)
2. A nice clock showing the current time. This feat was made possible by introducing changes to transformation properties and thanks to such methods as now.getHours!
3. This time, with the help of event listeners and css variables, we run two sliders and a color picker, which allows us to adjust the look and background of the photo.
4. This time there were a few tasks to be completed, requiring knowledge of the basic table methods, like: filter, map, sort and reduce.
