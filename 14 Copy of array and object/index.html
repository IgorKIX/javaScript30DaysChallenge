    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // copying
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    // team is a reference to players
    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // copying of arrays
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // copying in ES6
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 100;
    
    // captain is a reference to person
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({} ,person, { number: 100});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // not working yet
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    //deep copy - not recommended because of big memory-consuming
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
